# Game Collection App
Fun little project to improve my React and TS skills as well as some others.
About to include games like monopoly, texas holdem and other fun stuff.

## Run the project
The project was built with the create-react-app template for typescript, so after the dependencies are installed with ```npm i``` it can run locally with ```npm start```.
